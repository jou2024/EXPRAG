Task:
You are evaluating a discharge or follow-up instruction.
Your task is to assess whether the instruction is sufficient or inadequate based on the following criteria and return your evaluation in JSON format.

Evaluation Criteria:
1. If the instruction content is empty (e.g., "Follow-up instruction: ___"), mark it as "Fail."
2. A good instruction must include at least one of both:
    - What the patient should do ("what to do").
    - Warning signs that require contacting a doctor ("warning signs").
3. A common poor instruction only describes "what happened" without providing actionable steps ("what to do") or warnings ("warning signs").
4. If the instruction includes both "what happened" and "what to do"/"warning signs":
    - Identify and extract the points related to "what to do" and/or "warning signs."
    - List these points in the "selected_content" field in your JSON output.
5. For each point in "what to do" and "warning signs":
    - If there is only 1 point, or it is too general without useful information, mark it as "Fail."
    - For each point, provide:
        (1) A concise summary (few words).
        (2) A list of equivalent or closely related keywords.
        (3) The original sentence (if clear), or a rewritten instruction.

Ensure:
Split complex points into simple, concise points so that each can be represented by selecting 1 or at most 2 keywords from a list of equivalent terms(list of keywords).
Example 1 "sentence": "Your skin, or the whites of your eyes become yellow.", I cannot use "skin" or "eyes" as key word to represent the point. So this point should be split to 2 points like below:
    {
        "summary": "Skin turns yellow",
        "keywords": ["yellow skin", "jaundice"],
        "sentence": "Your skin becomes yellow."
    },
    {
        "summary": "Eyes turn yellow",
        "keywords": ["yellow eyes", "whites of eyes yellow", "jaundice"],
        "sentence": "The whites of your eyes become yellow."
    }
Example 2 "sentence": "You must continue to wear the clamshell brace when out of bed at all times.". It should be split to 2 points "wear the clamshell brace" and "wear the clamshell brace when out of bed at all times"

Here is the context:
---context starts---
{context}
---context ends---


Provide your evaluation in JSON format, as shown below:
{
  "reason": <Explanation for your decision>,
  "evaluation": <Pass, Fail, or Select>,
  "selected_content": <If "Select", include relevant points; otherwise, leave empty>,
  "points": {
    "what_to_do": [
      {
        "summary": <A few words summarizing the action>,
        "keywords": [<List of equivalent keywords>],
        "sentence": <The instruction sentence>
      }
      ...
    ],
    "warning_signs": [
      {
        "summary": <A few words summarizing the warning sign>,
        "keywords": [<List of equivalent keywords>],
        "sentence": <The warning sentence>
      }
      ...
    ]
  }
}

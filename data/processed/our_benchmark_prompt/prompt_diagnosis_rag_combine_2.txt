Answer a question for a target patient, who has background:
{background}

Question and options:{question}

{discharge_diagnosis_options}

Your solution should have only 2 parts:  "REASON" and "ANSWER", and start from "REASON".
The "REASON" part should be your reasoning process about why do you make that choice instead of copy the choice.
The "ANSWER" part should be the option letters only. Do not include the diagnosis name or words.
Please follow the format strictly.

"REASON": {Your reason here}
"ANSWER": {Your choice (letters only) here}

You have some EHR data/info retrieved from other similar patients to help you answer. Note, please think step by step that if each option should be documented in discharge diagnosis.

Your solution should have only 2 parts:  "REASON" and "ANSWER", and start from "REASON".
The "REASON" part should be less than 50 words and be your reasoning process about why do you make that choice instead of copy the choice.
The "ANSWER" part should be the option letters only. Do not include the medication name or words.
Please follow the format strictly.

"REASON": {Your reason here}
"ANSWER": {Your choice (letters only) here}
